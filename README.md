**Personal Website**

**Theme / Inspiration**
This is a simple personal website I built to introduce myself. It’s about who I am, where I study, and some of the hobbies I enjoy. I wanted to create a space online where I could showcase my background in a clean and personal way. The idea was to have something that feels like "me."

**Design Decisions**
I kept the design formal but simple. I used fonts that are easy to read because I always prefer clean and professional-looking text. For the colors, I went with black and blue. Black gives a professional and classy feel, and blue is a calming color that I personally like. Plus, blue is also the main color of my university’s brand — so it just felt right to include it.

**Challenges**
One of the challenges I faced was actually a pretty silly mistake — but it took me a while to figure it out. I had created my CSS file, but for some reason, none of the styles were showing up on my website. I kept trying to fix things, changing code, and getting frustrated. After spending a lot of time and even delaying the work, I finally realized… I hadn’t linked the CSS file correctly in the HTML! It was such a small thing, but it caused a lot of confusion. Lesson learned: always double-check your file paths!
